There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think about what it is you want from your life, and why.
You’ve struggled, you’ve suffered, but you have always followed your own path.
Sometimes life is like this tunnel. You can’t always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you keep moving, you will come to a better place.
You are not the man you used to be. You are stronger and wiser and freer than you ever used to be. You have come to the crossroads of your destiny. It is time for you to choose. It is time for you to choose good.
You are going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, you will be the beautiful prince you were always meant to be.
Failure is only the opportunity to begin again. Only this time, more wisely.
You must never give into despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts. In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength.
Destiny is a funny thing. You never know how things are going to work out. But if you keep an open mind and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday.
Is it your own destiny? Or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?  It’s time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions. Who are you and what do you want?
