I know you’re not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but it’s just so sad!
Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life’s true delights.
Sick of tea? That’s like being sick of breathing!
You should know this is not a natural sickness. But that shouldn’t stop you from enjoying tea.
This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!
So I was thinking about names for my new tea shop. How about the Jasmine Dragon? It’s dramatic, poetic. It has a nice ring to it.
You’re looking at the rare white dragon bush. Its leaves make a tea so delicious, it’s heartbreaking! That, or it’s the white jade bush, which is poisonous. Delectable tea or deadly poison.
